# Steps Followed in Task1
## Assignment 1
### 1a
- Read the image and converted it to grayscale, and then used threshold for black & white.
### 1b
- Started webcam and converted the video to grayscale.
### 1c
  - First converted BGR2RGB then converted to hsv.
  - Then created the masked image and then extracted blue from it.
## Assignment 2
- Read the image and resized it and converted it to grayscale.
- Used 4 translations, 4 Rotations, Affine Transformation, 2D Convolution and 4 Blurs using OpenCV Functions.
## Assignment 3
### 3a
- Read the image and converted it to GrayScale and performed GaussianBlur.
- Used the dodgeV2 (dodging function) to blend the original grayscale image with the blurred inverse, to get the Pencil Sketch.
### 3b
- Started webcam and converted the video to grayscale and performed GaussianBlur.
- Used the dodgeV2 (dodging function) to blend the original grayscale video with the blurred inverse, to get the Pencil Sketch.
