# Project (Un)Clear SoC_2021
Repository for (Un)Clear SoC Project 2021.

## Week 0:
- Completed the basic Python3 Tutorial, which acquainted me with basic functions and libraries in Python.
- Git Tutorial, which helped me get acquainted with GitHub!
- Google Colab Tutorial helped me get acquainted with Colab uses and its benefits.

## Week 1:
- OpenCV Tutorial taught me various new and interesting features in OpenCV like-
  - Image Processing in OpenCV
  - Feature Detection and Description in OpenCV
  - Video Analysis in OpenCV
- Completed **Assignment 1** based on implementation of various features of OpenCV.
- ML Course Part1 - Google Machine Learning Course helped me to learn basic Machine Learning concepts and ideas behind developing Machine Learning Algorithms. It also acquainted me with various features of numpy and pandas.

## Week 2:
- ML Course Part 2 - Learnt about the various terminologies involved such as Training, test and validation dataset, Feature crosses , Logistic regression , Neural Networks and Embeddings.
- Learnt about Tensor Flow which is a free and open-source software library for machine learning, through Udacity's Tensor Flow course where we learnt about CNNs and Transfer Learning.
- Completed **Assignment 2** based on implementation of this week's learnings, making a Digit Classifier using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks).

## Week 3:
- Learnt about a new convolutional model: ResNet (Residual Neural Network).
- Then learnt about GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), which are essentially deep generative models composed of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, opposed to each other through detailed tutorials and youtube videos. We also covered the losses involved in GANs and the various problems faced while using GANs.
- Completed **Assignment 3** based on the implementation of CGANs (Conditional GANs), which included making of a basic GAN which colours an anime-sketch based on a given input data.

## Week 4:
- Studied two of the latest papers in this field, one about Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) and other about Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGANs), which are much more advanced GANs by reading the original papers.
- Completed **Assignment 4** based on the implementation of ESRGAN model, which included choosing a low quality image and resolving it to a high quality using the implementation given in the paper.

## Week 5:
- Proper documentation and Video report making and final submission.
